# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask — or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we'll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

One of our goals is to ensure a welcoming environment for all contibutors to our projects. Our staff follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/LICENSE.md), [README](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/README.md) and its [Workflow](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/wiki/Workflow) process.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## Guidelines

### Contributor Guidelines for Design
We have provided some guidelines for folks who would like to submit new components to the Draft Web Design Standards and the lifecycle those new components will go through. For more detail, please visit the [guidelines on our wiki](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/wiki/Component-Maturity-Scale).

### Submitting an issue

To help us get a better understanding of the issue you're submitting, follow our ISSUE TEMPLATE and the guidelines it describes.

**Issue prioritization:**

1. lvl1 Defect - the functionality is broken or does not meet federal regulations.
2. lvl2 Defect - the functionality is annoying or designed incorrectly.
3. r&r - the functionality should be refactored or re-engineered in some way.
4. nf - the functionality does not exist yet.
